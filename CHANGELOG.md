# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Customizable dashboard: drag cards to rearrange, hide and restore them, save named layouts; responsive layout with a mobile navigation drawer
- Privacy mode that masks monetary values across the app while keeping counts, ratios and chart shapes
- Markdown notes with formatting toolbar, reusable templates, exact trade links, and image/PDF attachments on trades, days and notebook notes
- Advanced report filters, comparison groups, a two-way cross-analysis matrix, and additional breakdowns (asset class, month, entry/exit hour, position size, planned/realized R)
- Playbook rule checklists per trade with adherence rates and followed-vs-broken performance
- Routines with weekday schedules and completion history; a missed-opportunity log kept out of trading metrics
- PDF and PNG review exports; JSON export now includes folders, templates, rule assessments, routines and defaults
- Configurable breakeven tolerance, default fees, and default stop/target distances per account and symbol
- Importers: MetaTrader 5 deal reports and TradingView strategy exports
- Realized R accounts for contract multipliers and scaled entries
- Optional historical market data connections (London Strategic Edge, Alpaca, OANDA, Binance, Coinbase, or your own candle CSV) with estimated MAE/MFE and candle replay on closed trades
- Prop firm tracker: evaluation and reset costs, refunds, payout requests, receipts, cash ROI, renewals, attachments, CSV import and export
- Calendar insights, rolling performance trends, and a trade explorer scatter in Reports
- Light mode, a collapsible sidebar, and friendlier AI setup and error notices

### Changed

- Data loads render as React transitions, so a tab change paints progressively instead of freezing while every card and chart mounts at once
- The development server runs on Turbopack, roughly halving first-visit compile times when switching tabs in `pnpm dev`
- Removed the gradient accent bar and gradient Edge Score number; the active nav item and the score now use the solid brand blue
- Trade pages chart recorded fills only and never contact a data provider on open; market candles load only from a data source you choose
- Gross profit and gross loss now include every closed trade, so trades labeled breakeven by a tolerance still count; the Edge Score version is bumped to 2
- Reports and dashboard aggregation reuse daily totals and equity for large histories; charts load only the components they use
- Executions are validated and written together with their recomputed trades in one transaction
- Node 22 or newer is required (already required by the AI dependencies)

### Fixed

- Password protection now verifies the session signature on every API route. Previously, when `JOURNAL_PASSWORD` was set, any request carrying a cookie of the right name was accepted, so a forged cookie could read the journal.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-03

Initial public release.

### Added

- Round-trip engine: flat-to-flat position cycles from raw fills, FIFO/LIFO/weighted-average matching, partial fills, position flips, futures multipliers, rebuild-stable annotation keys (`@luxalgo/journal-core`)
- Analytics: P&L, win and day-win rates, profit factor, expectancy, R multiples, streaks, drawdown and recovery, profit concentration, calendar and bucket aggregations, the open Edge Score
- Statement importers with auto-detection for 12 formats, one-click TradeZella/Tradervue migration with exact P&L reconciliation, and a column mapper for anything else (`@luxalgo/journal-importers`)
- Web app: dashboard, P&L calendar, daily journal with voice dictation, trades table, trade pages with charting, notebook, playbooks, reports
- Broker sync via `@luxalgo/broker-sdk` with credentials encrypted at rest
- Optional AI reflection (bring your own Anthropic API key): session recaps, trade critiques, ask-your-journal
- Docker deployment, optional password auth, full JSON/CSV export
